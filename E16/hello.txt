The getWord function, as designed for this exercise, defines a "word" as a contiguous group of non-whitespace characters delineated by whitespace. Whitespace is identified using the Standard Library function isspace. It will return "words" that DO NOT contain printable characters. However, the function also returns a boolean value, via an output parameter, that indicates whether or not the word contains one or more printable characters as identified by the Standard Library function isprint. This will allow you to determine if you should use the word or not in the Word Frequency project.
