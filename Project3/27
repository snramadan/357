Tests htToArray on a hash table built with 1000 total entries of data that
contains sub-allocations of dynamic memory. The 1000 total entries includes
duplicates so the unique entries is something less than 1000. The metrics
(htMetrics) are also verified as well as the contents of the array returned
by htToArray.

Note: The hash table is destroyed and the array returned by htToArray are
freed after testing to allow for the use of valgrind to verify no memory
is leaked.
