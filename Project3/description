Test rehashing through several cycles. Testing includes:

   * Verifying the recycling happens at the correct time based on the load
     factor specified to htCreate and the contents of the hash table.
   * The hash table grows its capacity as specified by the sizes array
     specified to htCreate.
   * That the number of unique entries is maintained correctly.
   * That the number of total entries is maintained correctly.
   * That all of the entries can be found by htLookUp after rehashing.

Note: The hash table is destroyed after testing to allow for the use of
valgrind to verify no memory is leaked.
