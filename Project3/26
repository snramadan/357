Test building a hash table with 1000 total entries of data that contains
sub-allocations of dynamic memory. The 1000 total entries includes
duplicates so the unique entries is something less than 1000. The metrics
(htMetrics) are also verified.

Note: The hash table is destroyed to allow for the use of valgrind to
verify no memory is leaked.
